# liri-node-app

LIRI Bot is a nod command line program that can be used to query the Spotify, Bands in Town, and IMDB APIs. 
It uses Require, FS, and DotEnv npm packages. 

The user can add the following arguments to the command line and LIRI Bot will return a reponse from the chosen API - 

- spotify-this-song + a song title will give the user information about that specific song from the Spotify API.
- movie-this + a movie title will give the user information about that specific movie from the IMDB API.
- concert-this + a band or artist will give the user details about the next upcoming concert for that musician from the Bands in Town API. 
- do-what-it-says will pull pre-set parameter from random.txt and provide that information for the user.
